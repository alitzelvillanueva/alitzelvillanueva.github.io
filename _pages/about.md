My name is Alitzel Villanueva and I am Ph.D. student in Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB). My goal is to contribute to the scientific community as a principal investigator examining the environmental stressors in coastal systems and influence and inform environmental policy through research while mentoring the next generation of young scientists interested in conservation. Currently, I am investigating thermal effects on kelp forests, specifically, examining how exposure to heat stress via marine heatwaves (MHWs) can impact the early-life stages of giant kelp. I am working with Dr. Gretchen Hofmann to dive deeper into the role seasonality and biogeography play in giant kelp zoosporesâ€™ thermal tolerance as well as if there is a legacy effect due to MHWs experienced by adult kelp individuals in the Santa Barbara Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) in situ. These questions are crucial to making informed decisions that will allow us to conserve our seascape and are the main drivers in why I choose to pursue this path focused on climate effects on marine environments and organisms.
